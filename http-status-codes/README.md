# HTTP Status Codes

# **What are the most common HTTP status codes?**

HTTP status codes are essential in understanding the response returned by a server after making an HTTP request. They provide the information about the status of the request and response from the server.

### 🎯HTTP response codes are categorized into five groups:

Informational (100-199)

Success (200-299)

Redirection (300-399)

Client Error (400-499)

Server Error (500-599)

### 🎯Here are some of the most common HTTP status codes:

- 200 OK: This status code indicates that the request was successful.
- 404 Not Found: This status code indicates that the requested resource could not be found on the server.
- 500 Internal Server Error: This status code indicates that there was an error on the server that prevented the request from being fulfilled.
- 401 Unauthorized: This status code indicates that the client is not authorized to access the requested resource.
- 403 Forbidden: This status code indicates that the client does not have permission to access the requested resource.

These codes are just a few examples of the many HTTP status codes that exist. The exact list of most common HTTP status codes can vary depending on the context and the specific application.

Let me know in the comments😀
